# Malaria-Detection
A Malaria detection code written in python 
Millions of cases of Malaria are reported every year in India and other developing countries. In this video we build a Machine Learning / Computer vision solution that can help detecting presence of Malaria parasite in image of blood cell. We do this by using feature extraction techniques called contour detection and then using RandomForest Classifier.
